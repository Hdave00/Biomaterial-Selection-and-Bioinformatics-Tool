# Biomaterial-Selection-and-Bioinformatics-Tool

## NOTE-- This README is incomplete as of now, basic operational instructions only, complete details coming very soon!

## IMPORTANT -- Due to a python module failure, in matplotlib, the database is running into seg faults on streamlit, as a result only Metals and Alloys can be looked up in the Material Selection domain, and no other data is available! All other functionality in the other 2 domains is fully intact!

## Refer to the clean repo for code and implementation details, current repo is buggy! https://github.com/Hdave00/biomat-clean

A modern Streamlit-based biomaterials intelligence platform combining:

* **Local database search** (details coming soon...)
* **Materials Project API integration** (real-time crystal structure, elasticity, magnetism, bonding, oxidation, and thermodynamic data) details coming soon
* **3D structure visualization** using **py3Dmol**
    - Visualisation not yet implemented for 3D Structures of elements/materials, more details coming soon...
* **Machine-learning pipelines** for structure prediction (details coming ...)

This project is part of a larger effort to build an intelligent decision-support system for materials science and biomaterials engineering.
