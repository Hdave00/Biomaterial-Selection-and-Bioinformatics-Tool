This dataset contains data of over 2,600 alloys, including their chemical composition (%wt) across 30 elements, along with two key physical properties: tensile strength and melting point.

This Data can be easily used to train the ML and Deep Learning models on Alloys property.

I'm using it to train my RNN to learn the material's properties after training and testing for use in biomaterial selection.
