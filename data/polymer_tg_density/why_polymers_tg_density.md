This is an extensive dataset containing information about the various polymer's density and glass transition temprature. Similar to the metal and alloy properties this is instrumental in determining the biocompatibility of a given polymer by feeding vital context to the RNN model to determine a biocompatibility score. It contains about 165 different types of polymers, its names, the SMILES format based single repeating unit, grade of the polymer material, Tg and density.
