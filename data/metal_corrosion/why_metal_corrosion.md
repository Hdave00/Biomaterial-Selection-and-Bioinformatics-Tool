Corrosion is defined as the deterioration of a material due to chemical reactions with its environment. Understanding corrosion, and corrosion rates, is necessary to ensure that the design of objects we interact with every day, from the bridges we drive over to the containers used to transport chemicals, from the pipes that carry our water to the utensils we cook with, are safe and perform to specifications.

This data set is going to be used to train the RNN to determine what metal/alloy corrodes how much, in multiple given conditionS. It also will learn the rate of corrosion, the temprature at which the process took place and the duration of corrosion -> leading to a final observed phsysical effect/chemical effect on the material.
