NOTE this will have to be translated to english before the learning phase of the model.

"Synthetic protein dataset with sequences, physical properties, and functional classification for machine learning tasks."

This synthetic dataset was created to explore and develop machine learning models in bioinformatics. It contains 20,000 synthetic proteins, each with an amino acid sequence, calculated physicochemical properties, and a functional classification.

ID_Protein:             Unique identifier for each protein.
Sequence:               String of amino acids.
Molecular_Weight:       Molecular weight calculated from the sequence.
Isoelectric_Point:      Estimated isoelectric point based on the sequence composition.
Hydrophobicity:         Average hydrophobicity calculated from the sequence.
Total_Charge:           Sum of the charges of the amino acids in the sequence.
Polar_Proportion:       Percentage of polar amino acids in the sequence.
Nonpolar_Proportion:    Percentage of nonpolar amino acids in the sequence.
Sequence_Length:        Total number of amino acids in the sequence.
Class:                  The functional class of the protein, one of five categories: Enzyme, Transport, Structural, Receptor, Other.

This too will be extremely instrumental in teaching the ML model that combines ALL datasets about context based, core properties of a protein sequence and why those protiens are the way they are and HOW they will interact with the selected bio-material at a molecular level. Certain proteins have a tendency to attract to the opposite charge on the surface of the biomaterial which, on a micro-level could help understand and take precautions into consideration for the intended purpose.
