This is the primary dataset of Machine Design materials, which includes information on their mechanical properties. The dataset was obtained from the Autodesk Material Library and comprises 15 columns, also referred to as features/attributes. This dataset is a real-world dataset, and it does not contain any random values.

This data set is extremely value for making the ML model and training it on the data and properties of each material thereof like specified below. This will be the key dataset used to identify and recognise the variety and type of material for overall prosthetic compatibility. 

Standard (Std)
Unique Identification code for the Material (ID)
Material Name
Heat Treatment Method
Ultimate Tensile Strength (Su) in MPa
Yield Strength (Sy) in MPa
Elongation at Break or Strain (A5) as a Percentage
Brinell Hardness Number (BHN) in Microhardness Units
Elastic Modulus (E) in MPa
