This dataset provides the Young's Modulus values (in GPa) for 50 metals, covering a wide range of categories such as alkali metals, alkaline earth metals, transition metals, and rare earth elements. Young's Modulus is a fundamental mechanical property that measures a material's stiffness under tensile or compressive stress. It is critical for applications in materials science, physics, and engineering.

This is perhaps the most important physical factor in the selection of a biomaterial and calculating its biocompatibility for the intended use case. Whether it is a total endoprosthesis or a novel nerve/vessel connection directly with nano computing (MEMS) systems to seamlessly replace a human limb with a bionic prosthetic/enhancement while maintaining complete biofunctionality albeit artificially.

The youngs modulus of 50 core metal elements will provide an extremely solid baseline and fallback prediction vector for building the biocompatibility score, and to train the ML model.
