Learning about crystals could be useful for the ML RNN model to determine edge cases by inference about the properties of what king of effect that particular crystal structure in a given material can have when used in a biomaterial context. For example, Perovskite-type oxides are

**Catalysis:**
Used in oxidation or reduction reactions due to their stability and ability to exsolve catalytically active elements to form nanoparticles. 

**Electronics:**
Employed in microelectronics for their dielectric, ferroelectric, and piezoelectric properties. 

**Energy Conversion and Storage:**
Contribute to applications in areas like batteries and fuel cells due to their mixed electronic and ionic conductivity.
