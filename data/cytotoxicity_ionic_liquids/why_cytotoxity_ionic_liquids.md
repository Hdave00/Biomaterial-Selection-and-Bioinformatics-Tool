A comprehensive dataset on cytotoxicity of ionic liquids

Ionic liquids (ILs) are structurally tunable salts with applications ranging from chemical synthesis to batteries, novel materials and medicine. Despite their potential, the toxicity of ILs poses significant environmental and biological challenges. This study introduces a comprehensive dataset of cytotoxicity of 1227 ILs, compiled from 151 research papers and encompassing 3837 data entries. For each entry, the following information is provided: substance name, empirical formula, CAS, SMILES, molecular weight, cytotoxicity value, details on the experimental setup (incubation time, cell line, assay used, etc.), and reference to the original publication. This dataset can be used for deriving structure‒activity relationships and establishing the major structural elements that govern the cytotoxic effects of ILs on eukaryotic cells.

To determine the cytotoxity of ionic liquids that could be found in both humans, and in medical implants, we need this dataset. Particularly useful to train our ML model on what to look out for when considering the erosion rate for a majority polymer based implant in, or on the human body making contact.
